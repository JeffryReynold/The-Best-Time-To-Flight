# The-Best-Time-To-Flight

Introduction
	Flight delay is a global issue that affects the aviation industry, with the average delay time being approximately 42 minutes in 2021. There are various factors that contribute to flight delay, including weather conditions, technical issues, air traffic congestion, crew unavailability, and airport infrastructure problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated the problem, leading to reduced capacity and operational challenges for airlines. Flight delay can have significant impacts on both airlines and passengers, resulting in financial losses, missed connections, and travel disruptions. To address this issue, airlines have implemented various measures such as improving operational efficiency and investing in new technology.
	Using statistical analysis in the process of analyzing flight delay is essential because it provides a quantitative approach to understanding the factors that contribute to delay. Statistical analysis can help identify patterns and trends in the data, which can provide valuable insights into the root causes of delay. By using statistical models, analysts can identify the most significant variables that contribute to flight delay, such as weather conditions, air traffic congestion, and technical issues. Additionally, statistical analysis can help airlines optimize their operations by identifying areas where they can improve efficiency and reduce delays. Overall, statistical analysis is a powerful tool that can help airlines and industry stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve the reliability and efficiency of air travel.


Conclusions:

The best time to fly to avoid delays is in June on Thursday and Friday and at 5 am.
Old planes are not the cause of flight delays.
No significant changes to airplane flight routes despite an increase in the number of users.
The main causes of flight delays are Origin_long, Month, Origin_lat while Distance, dest_lat and CRSElapsedTime are not causes of flight delays.
Linear regression shows no significant relationship with distance, dest_lat and CRSElapsedTime.


Recommandation:

    • Based on the results of statistical tests where one of the causes of flight delays is the month of the flight. so we recommend that business people and tourists can schedule activities that will use airplane transportation in June our day or Friday and flight at 5 am.
    • Improve scheduling algorithms: Based on the analysis of the dataset, the best time to fly to minimize delays is in June on Thursday and Friday and at 5 am. Airlines can use this information to optimize their flight schedules and reduce delays.
    • Improve airport infrastructure: The analysis shows that the variables Origin_long and Origin_lat are significant factors in causing flight delays. This suggests that airports with poor infrastructure or congested runways may contribute to delays. Improving airport infrastructure, such as building more runways or expanding terminal capacity, could help reduce delays.
    • Improve maintenance and repair processes: While the analysis did not find a significant relationship between delay time and plane manufacturing year, it is still possible that older planes may require more maintenance and repairs, which can cause delays. Airlines can improve their maintenance and repair processes to ensure that planes are kept in good condition and reduce delays caused by mechanical issues.
    • Improve communication with passengers: Airlines can use the information from the analysis to communicate with passengers about the best times to fly and potential delays. By proactively communicating with passengers, airlines can manage expectations and reduce the impact of delays on customers.
