# The-Best-Time-To-Flight
Conclusions
    • The best time to fly to avoid delays is in June on Thursday and Friday and at 5 am.
    • Old planes are not the cause of flight delays.
    • No significant changes to airplane flight routes despite an increase in the number of users.
    • The main causes of flight delays are Origin_long, Month, Origin_lat while Distance, dest_lat and CRSElapsedTime are not causes of flight delays.
    • Linear regression shows no significant relationship with distance, dest_lat and CRSElapsedTime.


Recommandation
    • Based on the results of statistical tests where one of the causes of flight delays is the month of the flight. so we recommend that business people and tourists can schedule activities that will use airplane transportation in June our day or Friday and flight at 5 am.
    • Improve scheduling algorithms: Based on the analysis of the dataset, the best time to fly to minimize delays is in June on Thursday and Friday and at 5 am. Airlines can use this information to optimize their flight schedules and reduce delays.
    • Improve airport infrastructure: The analysis shows that the variables Origin_long and Origin_lat are significant factors in causing flight delays. This suggests that airports with poor infrastructure or congested runways may contribute to delays. Improving airport infrastructure, such as building more runways or expanding terminal capacity, could help reduce delays.
    • Improve maintenance and repair processes: While the analysis did not find a significant relationship between delay time and plane manufacturing year, it is still possible that older planes may require more maintenance and repairs, which can cause delays. Airlines can improve their maintenance and repair processes to ensure that planes are kept in good condition and reduce delays caused by mechanical issues.
    • Improve communication with passengers: Airlines can use the information from the analysis to communicate with passengers about the best times to fly and potential delays. By proactively communicating with passengers, airlines can manage expectations and reduce the impact of delays on customers.
